# Creating your own iOS custom pages

So you want to write your own Liger pages in Objective-C? Then you've come to the right place!
Using the standard Liger page 'browser' as an example we'll walk you through how it works.

This guide will assume that you are familiar with Xcode and iOS.

## Inherit from LGRViewController

The first thing you want to do is create a new UIViewController, name it something appropriate
and then inherit from LGRViewController instead. This is the relevant code from LGRBrowserViewController:

	#import "LGRViewController.h"

	@interface LGRBrowserViewController : LGRViewController

	@end

## Page name

The next step is making sure the Liger framework finds your custom page. Decide on a name and
implement the nativePage class method. This is the string you will use in openPage and openDialog
to open up your page. This so that it can be opened both from Javascript and Objective-C. You can
create and use it as a normal UIViewController as well as LGRViewController inherits from it. A
nice bonus is that the functionality to open pages and dialogs comes from LGRViewController so if
you want to open an HTML page (or another custom page) from your custom page you can do so. This
way your own custom pages aren't relegated to being leaves in the UI's navigational model.

Here's the relevant code from LGRBrowserViewController:

	+ (NSString*)nativePage
	{
		return @"browser";
	}

## Initializing your custom page

LGRPageFactory needs to be able to initialize your custom page properly, and that's done using
the initWithPage:title:args: selector. It's up to you how much of the arguments are useful to
you but you have to make sure that you call one of LGRViewController's two init methods. If you
want to use a nib/xib file for your custom class you initWithPage:title:args:nibName:bundle:
instead of initWithPage:title:args:. They both perform the same essential function, and among
other things will save the page, title, and args that is later accessible through properties.

If your custom page takes arguments you can extract them here to change the behavior of your
controller, or you can use self.args[@"key"] to access them later on.

Here's the relevant code from LGRBrowserViewController with the custom init removed for clarity.

	- (id)initWithPage:(NSString*)page title:(NSString*)title args:(NSDictionary*)args
	{
		self = [super initWithPage:page title:title args:args nibName:@"LGRBrowserViewController" bundle:nil];
		if (self) {
			// Custom init code goes here
		}
		return self;
	}

## Write your new custom page!

The sky's the limit! You can add or do anything you normally can do with a UIViewController. If you want to
embed another UIViewController or class inheriting from it you can do so as a child view controller. This is
how we implement the HTML controller ourselves. It's also highly recommended that you use the built in methods
to open and close pages and dialogs rather than using the UIViewController's methods directly. This to avoid
bugs when using the page inside of the Liger framework.

That said, you might want to provide even more advanced functionality. If that's the case try to use the
methods in LGRViewController and overload them where appropriate. You can provide custom animations for a
UINavigationController push of a view controller this way for instance. Don't be afraid to look at Liger's
source code to figure this out either.

## Giving back

Feel free to contribute custom pages back to the community. Maybe in the form of a custom page cocoa pod even.
That way others can include your work easily. Maybe you have a service you want other's to use, or a piece of
hardware you sell and a custom page is a great way to expose that. Or your custom page is just generally very
cool and useful! Don't forget that you can distribute pre-made HTML pages as well. Remember, everyone's invited!

# But dear Liger developers, I already have a UIViewController!

Maybe it's already written, maybe you can't change it for some reason. Maybe even worse, you don't even have the
source code! Is all lost? No, you are in luck! Apple provides a number of a useful dialogs and we expose them in
Liger. The caveat is that they have to be leaf nodes, as they don't know how to open up a new page. The good news
is that it's pretty much always the case anyways.

## Show what do I do then?

You create a class that uses the LGRImportedViewConctroller (importing into Liger) protocol:

	#import "LGRImportedViewController.h"

	@interface LGRMessageImported : NSObject <LGRImportedViewController>

	@end

And as you might have figured out we are using the iOS message controller as an example. This is included in Liger
so you can go look at the full source code for the details.

The next step is giving it a page name:

	+ (NSString*)importedPage
	{
		return @"message";
	}

And a way to initialize the imported page:

	+ (UIViewController*)controllerForImportedPage:(NSString*)page title:(NSString*)title args:(NSDictionary*)args parent:(LGRViewController*)parent
	{
		MFMessageComposeViewController *picker = [[MFMessageComposeViewController alloc] init];

		picker.recipients = [self recipientsArray:args[@"recipients"]];
		picker.subject = args[@"subject"];
		picker.body = args[@"body"];
		
		picker.delegate = parent;
		
		return picker;
	}

Something worth nothing, if you run into the same situation is this line:

	picker.delegate = parent;

LGRMessageImported has no idea about the callbacks for the message composer's delegate. So what I did was to add a
category to LGRViewController so it knows how to answer the delegate callback. Take a look in "LGRViewController+MessageUI.h".
There are a number of protocols and other things added to the category on LGRViewcontroller, and we implement the callbacks.
This way we can use the parent of our page as our delegate and react properly. And here's what we do in the callback:

	- (void)messageComposeViewController:(MFMessageComposeViewController *)controller didFinishWithResult:(MessageComposeResult)result
	{
		[self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{
			[self dialogClosed:@{@"result": [NSNumber numberWithInteger:result]}];
		}];
	}

When the message has been sent we dismiss the view controller, and when that has finished we send the dialogClosed: message
with our result. This way, the parent page gets the information back in the normal Liger way, and both custom pages and
HTML pages know what to do. Some dialogs are going to be far more interesting, others more mundane. For a really
interesting use look at the imported image dialog's callback:

	- (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
	{
		NSString *url = [info[UIImagePickerControllerMediaURL] absoluteString];
		if (!url)
			url = [info[UIImagePickerControllerReferenceURL] absoluteString];

		if (!url)
			url = @"";

		NSDictionary *metaData = info[UIImagePickerControllerMediaMetadata];
		if (!metaData) {
			metaData = @{};
		}
		
		[self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{
			[self dialogClosed:@{@"MediaType": info[UIImagePickerControllerMediaType], @"URL": url, @"MetaData": metaData}];
		}];
	}

Here, when we close the dialog, we send back the URL for an image, with some other nice-to-have data. You can ask the user to select
an image and then use that URL (due to some magic currently residing in Cordova) directly in your HTML app. That's pretty neat!
